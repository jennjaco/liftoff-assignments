# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Everyone forgets important birthdays and anniversaries from time to time, or has experienced the anxiety of trying to remember something a loved one has mentioned wanting. My application will eliminate all of those worries! Users will be able to create a private account where they can build their own database of friends, family, and coworkers. Within each loved one’s individual profile users will be able to not only input important dates such as anniversaries and birthdays, but also log gift ideas! Out shopping with mom and she loves something but decides not to buy it for herself? Put it in her profile! When her birthday comes around there will be no stress about finding the perfect gift. Users will also be able to keep track of a person’s favorite items such as preferred foods, scents, and drinks to make a hostess gift easy to pick up knowing it’ll be a winner.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application
Search: Users will be able to search for a specific person’s name
Sort: A Sorting feature to see a list of people based on relationship type (family, friend, etc.)
Create: A specific entry for each person

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
